1. Single Responsiblity Principle
	- A class should only have one reason to change
	- Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems
2. Open-Closed Principle
	- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
	- You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype
4. Interface Segregationo Principle
	- Don't put too much into an initerface; split into separate interfaces
	- YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Neet It
5. Dependency Inversion Principle
	- High-Level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
